note bottom of tempSensor
    Measure the temperature and outputs it as
    raw, unfiltered value in Kelvin.

note bottom of tempProcessing
    Takes the given raw temperature values
    in Kelvin, puts a moving average with
    configurable window size on it, converts
    it to degree and outputs that value.

    Gets as input a temperature in
