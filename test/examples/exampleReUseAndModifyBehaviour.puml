title Example on how to re-use and extend an existing sequence

' put the re-usable sequence onto the diagram
PUMLAPutElement(internalSequence)

' now, if you look into the code of the sequence
' (find out which file with the PUMLACheatSheetAllAttributes)
' you know the name of the elements.
' You can attach additional notes to it...
note left of getSignal
    This note has
    not been put
    into the re-usable
    element, but
    only on this diagram.
end note

note across
    I can also write something across all the elements.
    It does not matter that the sequence and box is already
    closed. The "across" relates it to the last sequence.
end note

note over "AD conversion"
    some additional
    note here...
end note

' I can also extend the diagram at the bottom
internalSequence -> "getSignal" : plausibilization
activate getSignal
getSignal -> "signal processing" : signal check
activate "signal processing"
return signal ok?
return check ok?
