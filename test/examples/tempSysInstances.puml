' here 2 re-usable instances of tempSys are defined.
' see line 2, where we mark this as instance file.
' other re-usable element files shall only contain
' one model element (atomic definition). but for
' instances that might be annoying, so we make an
' exception to allow for multiple instance element
' definitions in one file.

' create the instance "ts1" of model element with alias "tempSys".
' the name contains whitespaces, therefore name and alias are
' not equal and this version of the macro is called.

' create another instance "ts2" from same model element.
' the instance name equals the alias, therefore is not
' allowed to contain whitespaces.
