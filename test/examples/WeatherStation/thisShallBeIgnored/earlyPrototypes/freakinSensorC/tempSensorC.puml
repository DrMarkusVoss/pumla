note bottom of tempSensorC
    Temperature Sensor of company C.
    Provides the temperature in degree
    Fahrenheit.

    This is so coolest sensor I have ever
    seen. It's design is marvelous, also
    from the inside. I do not care if it
    costs 5 times the price of the
    competitor products. It's the one
    I want to use.
