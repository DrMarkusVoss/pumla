title Example using an Element Filter

' this is standard PlantUML.
' Choosing a nice scheme and
' adopting the background color.
!$BGCOLOR=LightGrey
!theme sketchy-outline

' this is PUMLA-specific, the color of tagged value
' notes
!$PUMColorTaggedValues = darkgreen

note as note1
The element type filter for this diagram is set to "node"
and the element stereotype filter is set to "external System".
That is why on this diagram only "Temperature Sensor B (dC)"
and "Temp. Converter" appear. All other elements that are put
on are filtered out.

Also using the "sketchy-outline" theme here, therefore adopted
the backgroundcolor for the tagged values note to darkgreen.

' without this line the interfaces of the component

PUMLASetAsComponentDiagram()

PUMLASetElementFilterOutTagValue("SysVariant", "B")

' put the following elements on the diagram:


PUMLAPutElement(tempConverter)

PUMLAPutElement(tempSys)

PUMLAPutElement(tempSensorBdC)

' the port porttempdc should be filtered
' out as it has a tag/value pair "SysVariant"/"B"
